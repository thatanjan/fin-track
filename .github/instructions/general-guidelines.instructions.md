## General Guidelines

- **Consistency**: Follow a consistent coding style throughout the project. This includes naming conventions, file organization, and code formatting.

- Don't remove the changes I make in the codebase unless I specifically ask you to do so.

- Always use arrow functions and functional components in React.
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better code quality.
- Write meaningful commit messages that clearly describe the changes made.

- Use proper spacing and indentation to enhance code readability.
- Avoid using inline styles; instead, use tailwind css class.
- Write modular and reusable code to promote maintainability.
- Try to use short syntax wherever possible.

## Components guidelines

- Always use Shadcn UI components as the base for building UI elements. This ensures consistency in design and behavior across the application.

- For any new UI component, first check if a Shadcn UI component exists that can be extended or customized to meet your needs. Use the `#get-library-docs` helper command to access the Shadcn UI documentation.

- If a suitable Shadcn UI component is not available, create a new component following the design principles and styles outlined in the Shadcn UI documentation.

- check `.github/instructions/folder-structure.instructions.md` for folder structure guidelines.
